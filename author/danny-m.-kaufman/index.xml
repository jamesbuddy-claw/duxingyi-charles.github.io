&lt;h3 id=&#34;abstract&#34;&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Abstract&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/h3&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Computing injective maps with low distortions is a long-standing problem in computer graphics. Such maps are particularly challenging to obtain in the presence of positional constraints, because an injective initial map is often not available. Recently, several energies were proposed and shown to be highly successful in optimizing injectivity from non-injective initial maps while satisfying positional constraints. However, minimizing these energies tends to produce elements with significant isometric distortions. This paper presents simple variants of these energies that retain their desirable traits while promoting isometry. While our method is not guaranteed to provide an injective map, we observe that, on large-scale 2D and 3D data sets, minimizing the proposed isometric variants results in a similar level of success in recovering injectivity as the original energies but a significantly lower isometric distortion.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h3 id=&#34;abstract&#34;&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Abstract&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/h3&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Injective parameterizations of triangulated meshes are critical across applications but remain challenging to compute. Existing algorithms to find injectivity either require initialization from an injective starting state, which is currently only possible without positional constraints, or else can only prevent triangle inversion, which is insufficient to ensure injectivity. Here we present, to our knowledge, the first algorithm for recovering a globally injective parameterization from an arbitrary non-injective initial mesh subject to stationary constraints. These initial meshes can be inverted, wound about interior vertices and/or overlapping. Our algorithm in turn enables globally injective mapping for meshes with arbitrary positional constraints. Our key contribution is a new energy, called smooth excess area (SEA), that measures non-injectivity in a map. This energy is well-defined across both injective and non-injective maps and is smooth almost everywhere, making it readily minimizable using standard gradient-based solvers starting from a non-injective initial state. Importantly, we show that maps minimizing SEA are guaranteed to be locally injective and almost globally injective, in the sense that the overlapping area can be made arbitrarily small. Analyzing SEA’s behavior over a new benchmark set designed to test injective mapping, we find that optimizing SEA successfully recovers globally injective maps for 85% of the benchmark and obtains locally injective maps for 90%. In contrast, state-of-the-art methods for removing triangle inversion obtain locally injective maps for less than 6% of the benchmark, and achieve global injectivity (largely by chance as prior methods are not designed to recover it) on less than 4%.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h3 id=&#34;abstract&#34;&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Abstract&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/h3&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Mapping a source mesh into a target domain while preserving local injectivity is an important but highly non-trivial task. Existing methods either require an already-injective starting configuration, which is often not available, or rely on sophisticated solving schemes. We propose a novel energy form, called Total Lifted Content (&lt;strong&gt;TLC&lt;/strong&gt;), that is equipped with theoretical properties desirable for injectivity optimization. By lifting the simplices of the mesh into a higher dimension and measuring their contents (2D area or 3D volume) there, &lt;strong&gt;TLC&lt;/strong&gt; is smooth over the entire embedding space and its global minima are always injective. The energy is simple to minimize using standard gradient-based solvers. Our method achieved &lt;em&gt;100&lt;/em&gt;% success rate on an extensive benchmark of embedding problems for triangular and tetrahedral meshes, on which existing methods only have varied success.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;We present the large benchmark dataset of 2D/3D meshes used to compare with previous methods. The dataset includes &lt;em&gt;10743&lt;/em&gt; triangular mesh examples and &lt;em&gt;904&lt;/em&gt; tetrahedral mesh examples. The dataset is divided into 3 categories, 2D parameterization, 3D parameterization and 3D deformation.&lt;/p&gt;
