&lt;h3 id=&#34;abstract&#34;&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Abstract&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/h3&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Computing injective maps with low distortions is a long-standing problem in computer graphics. Such maps are particularly challenging to obtain in the presence of positional constraints, because an injective initial map is often not available. Recently, several energies were proposed and shown to be highly successful in optimizing injectivity from non-injective initial maps while satisfying positional constraints. However, minimizing these energies tends to produce elements with significant isometric distortions. This paper presents simple variants of these energies that retain their desirable traits while promoting isometry. While our method is not guaranteed to provide an injective map, we observe that, on large-scale 2D and 3D data sets, minimizing the proposed isometric variants results in a similar level of success in recovering injectivity as the original energies but a significantly lower isometric distortion.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h3 id=&#34;abstract&#34;&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Abstract&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/h3&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Implicit surface networks, such as arrangements of implicit surfaces and materials interfaces, are used for modeling piecewise smooth or partitioned shapes. However, accurate and numerically robust algorithms for discretizing either structure on a grid are still lacking. We present a unified approach for computing both types of surface networks for piecewise linear functions defined on a tetrahedral grid. Both algorithms are guaranteed to produce a correct combinatorial structure for any number of functions. Our main contribution is an exact and efficient method for partitioning a tetrahedron using the level sets of linear functions defined by barycentric interpolation. To further improve performance, we designed look-up tables to speed up processing of tetrahedra involving few functions and introduced an efficient algorithm for identifying nested 3D regions.&lt;/p&gt;

Voronoi diagrams of 3D lines (top left: 5 rotating lines; top right: 20 rotating lines; bottom left: 21 lines that sweep a Mobius strip) and circles (bottom right: 22 Villarceau circles on two tori) computed by our algorithm and the label-separating algorithm. The zoom-in views highlight regions on the non-manifold curve networks where the two algorithms produce notably different geometry and/or topology. The combinatorial complexity of each surface network and the running times (up to mesh extraction, before space decomposition) are noted.

&lt;h3 id=&#34;abstract&#34;&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Abstract&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/h3&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Injective parameterizations of triangulated meshes are critical across applications but remain challenging to compute. Existing algorithms to find injectivity either require initialization from an injective starting state, which is currently only possible without positional constraints, or else can only prevent triangle inversion, which is insufficient to ensure injectivity. Here we present, to our knowledge, the first algorithm for recovering a globally injective parameterization from an arbitrary non-injective initial mesh subject to stationary constraints. These initial meshes can be inverted, wound about interior vertices and/or overlapping. Our algorithm in turn enables globally injective mapping for meshes with arbitrary positional constraints. Our key contribution is a new energy, called smooth excess area (SEA), that measures non-injectivity in a map. This energy is well-defined across both injective and non-injective maps and is smooth almost everywhere, making it readily minimizable using standard gradient-based solvers starting from a non-injective initial state. Importantly, we show that maps minimizing SEA are guaranteed to be locally injective and almost globally injective, in the sense that the overlapping area can be made arbitrarily small. Analyzing SEA’s behavior over a new benchmark set designed to test injective mapping, we find that optimizing SEA successfully recovers globally injective maps for 85% of the benchmark and obtains locally injective maps for 90%. In contrast, state-of-the-art methods for removing triangle inversion obtain locally injective maps for less than 6% of the benchmark, and achieve global injectivity (largely by chance as prior methods are not designed to recover it) on less than 4%.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h3 id=&#34;abstract&#34;&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Abstract&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/h3&gt;
&lt;p&gt;We present a novel representation of solid models for shape design. Like Constructive Solid Geometry (CSG), the solid shape is constructed from a set of halfspaces without the need for an explicit boundary structure. Instead of using Boolean expressions as in CSG, the shape is defined by sparsely placed samples on the boundary of each halfspace. This representation, called Boundary-Sampled Halfspaces (BSH), affords greater agility and expressiveness than CSG while simplifying the reverse engineering process. We discuss theoretical properties of the representation and present practical algorithms for boundary extraction and conversion from other representations. Our algorithms are demonstrated on both 2D and 3D examples.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Mapping a source mesh into a target domain while preserving local injectivity is an important but highly non-trivial task. Existing methods either require an already-injective starting configuration, which is often not available, or rely on sophisticated solving schemes. We propose a novel energy form, called Total Lifted Content (&lt;strong&gt;TLC&lt;/strong&gt;), that is equipped with theoretical properties desirable for injectivity optimization. By lifting the simplices of the mesh into a higher dimension and measuring their contents (2D area or 3D volume) there, &lt;strong&gt;TLC&lt;/strong&gt; is smooth over the entire embedding space and its global minima are always injective. The energy is simple to minimize using standard gradient-based solvers. Our method achieved &lt;em&gt;100&lt;/em&gt;% success rate on an extensive benchmark of embedding problems for triangular and tetrahedral meshes, on which existing methods only have varied success.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h3 id=&#34;abstract&#34;&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Abstract&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/h3&gt;
&lt;p&gt;In order to generate high quality quad mesh, a novel method based on field-aligned centroidal Voronoi tessellation (CVT) is proposed. Target mesh vertices are first uniformly distributed on input mesh surface via CVT optimization. Then, field-aligned CVT is applied to align mesh edges to the underlying direction field. Next, an initial quad mesh is extracted by matching mesh edges and field directions. Meanwhile, singular vertices are detected and eliminated based on topology optimization. Finally, the output quad-dominant mesh is generated by merging adjacent triangle pairs. Experiments show that our method has the ability to generate field-aligned high quality quad-dominant mesh.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;/figure&gt;

&lt;h3 id=&#34;abstract&#34;&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Abstract&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/h3&gt;
&lt;p&gt;We present a novel isotropic surface remeshing algorithm that automatically aligns the mesh edges with an underlying directional field. The alignment is achieved by minimizing an energy function that combines both centroidal Voronoi tessellation and the penalty enforced by a six-way rotational symmetry (6-RoSy) field. The CVT term ensures the uniform distribution of thevertices and the high remeshing quality, while the field constraint enforces the directional alignment of the edges. Experimental results show that the proposed approach has the advantages of both isotropic remeshing and field-aligned remeshing. We demonstrate that our algorithm is superior to the representative state-of-the-art approaches in various aspects.&lt;/p&gt;
